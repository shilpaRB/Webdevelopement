                  <p>
                        CSS positioning allows you to control the layout of HTML elements using properties such 
                        as top, right, bottom, and left. Understanding the different types of position properties 
                        in CSS—static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky—can enhance the design and functionality
                        of web pages. This article explores these properties 
                        with examples, illustrating how each can be applied to achieve various layout effects.

                  <h3 class="sub-headings">Static Position</h3>
                  <p>
                        Static positioning is the default that every element gets.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="sub-headings">Relative Position</h3>
                  <p>
                        Relative positioning changes the position of the HTML
                        element relative to where it normally appears.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="sub-headings">Absolute Position</h3>
                  <p>
                        Absolute positioning defines the position of a given bounding box from 
                        the top and left side margins of the web page. This not only allows objects to
                        be placed in an exact location, it also allows objects to be placed one on top of another.    
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="sub-headings">Fixed Position</h3>
                  <p>
                        An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always
                        stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are
                        used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally
                        have been located.   
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="sub-headings">Sticky Position</h3>
                  <p>
                        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed , depending on the scroll position.
                        It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place. 
                  </p>
